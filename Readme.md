1) 20 hours rule

1) 20 hours Rule :
   Allocate dedicated time (Time block)
   Remove any distractions
   Practise in intense, short sessions (<2hrs)

 2) Deconstruct the skill : Breakdown any skill into smaller, manageable chunks  >> Going PRECISE :
    Identify key components of the skill
    Pracitce each component separately
    Once you've mastered each part, start combining them

  3) Use the Feynman technique :
     Teach it to child
     Identify gaps in your explanation
     Review & simplify the concept until you can explain it to a 5-yr old

  4) Spaced Repetition
     Revisit the skill or topic on a consistent cadence. Best practise is monthly.

  5) Embrace mistakes: Be okay screwing up... Fear of mistakes can slow down learning...
     Make mistakes a part of your learning journey
     Mistakes unlock knowledge gaps
     Progress >> Perfection

 6) Use Technology : Take advantage of technology. TECHNOLOGY is the FORCE MULTIPLIER to your learning
