JAVA Issues:
*************
1) UnsupportedOperationException occurs when trying to add elements to an arryalist created using Arrays.asList

The UnsupportedOperationException occurs when trying to modify an immutable list that is created from an array using the Arrays.asList() method. The Arrays.asList() method creates a fixed-size list backed by the original array, which means that you cannot add or remove elements from the list.

To overcome this issue, you can create a new ArrayList from the Arrays.asList() result, which will create a mutable list:

Eg:
 List<String> fixedSizeList = Arrays.asList(arr);   // This creates an IMMUTABLE list
 List<String> mutableLst = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(arr)); // This creates a mutable list
